                    	<h2>Registering online service</h2>
                        
                    	<p>To register for online shopping, you must log into the server <code>play.mctnet.tk</code> on Minecraft PC. And type the following command in <b>Games Server</b> to set a online shopping password for your account:</p>
                        <pre>/shop online [password] [confirmPassword]</pre>
                        
                        <p>You are required to set a 8-letter password with at least one capital letter, one number character, one non-alphanumeric character. For example:</p>
                        
                        <pre>/shop online Minecr@ft123 Minecr@ft123</pre>
                        
                        <p>You can test the functionality by purchasing an item on this website.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Disabling online service</h2>
                        
                        <p>Online shopping service can be disabled and unregistered anytime when you are logged into the server <code>play.mctnet.tk</code> on Minecraft PC. Type the following command in <b>Games Server</b>:</p>
                        
                        <pre>/shop disableonline</pre>
                        
                        <h2>Changing password</h2>
                        
                        <p>Changing password is the same as how you register the online service. If you forget your password, <b>DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FIND IT BY ENTERING TO THE LOGIN PAGE</b>. This might block your IP. You <b>SHOULD</b> change the password in-game instead.</p>
